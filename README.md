# ELEC-E8408 Embedded System Development

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the `ELEC-E8408 Embedded System Development` course. This repository contains the source code and resources for the Raspberry Pi server project, an integral part of our course curriculum.

## Course Overview

This course focuses on developing practical skills in embedded system design and implementation, using the Raspberry Pi as a primary platform. Students will gain hands-on experience in both hardware interfacing and software development, culminating in the creation of a fully functional embedded system server.

## Getting Started

Before diving into the project, ensure that you have a basic understanding of embedded systems, Raspberry Pi, Python, and Node.js.

### Prerequisites

- Raspberry Pi (configured and running)
- Python 3.10.12
- Node.js (npm 10.5.0)
- Yarn package manager

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    git clone https://github.com/Embedded-Systems-Group-H/Rpi-server.git
   

2. Check out the `frontend-backend` branch for the latest development code:
   

3. Install all necessary dependencies:


## Running the Server

The project is divided into three main components: the server, the data request routine, and the client.

### Server

1. Navigate to the `server` folder:
2. Start the server using Node.js:
   
   

### Data Request Routine

1. To run the routine request for new incoming data:
   python3 get_data_server.py

   

### Client

1. Navigate to the `client` folder:
2. Start the client application using Yarn:
